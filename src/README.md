# FlexASIO Developer Information

## Building

FlexASIO is designed to be built using CMake within the Microsoft Visual C++
2019 toolchain native CMake support.

FlexASIO uses a CMake "superbuild" system (in `/src`) to automatically build the
dependencies (most notably [PortAudio][]) before building FlexASIO itself. These
dependencies are pulled in as git submodules.

It is strongly recommended to use the superbuild system. Providing dependencies
manually is quite tedious because FlexASIO uses a highly modular structure that
relies on many small subprojects.

Note that the ASIOUtil build system will download the [ASIO SDK][] for you
automatically at configure time.

## Packaging

The following command will do a clean superbuild and generate a FlexASIO
installer package for you:

```
cmake -P installer.cmake
```

Note that for this command to work, you need to have [Inno Setup][] installed.

## Troubleshooting

### VC runtime DLLs are not included in the installation

; Module-definition file for the FlexASIO DLL
; Our DLL is a COM class factory, so we only need to export the functions required by COM.
; We can't use declspec(dllexport) for those because the naming convention doesn't match (leading "@")
; We also a couple of functions for users that want to instantiate FlexASIO directly (e.g. FlexASIOTest).
